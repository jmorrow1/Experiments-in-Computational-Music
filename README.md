# What

This is a series exploring music through computation. For each entry, I start with a concept and develop it through software. There is a write-up that explains the concept and describes what I did with it. Some of the software is embedded in the write-up. 

Computation has many uses throughout this project, including:
* To create music through algorithms, step-by-step processes
* To transform existing music through algorithms
* To act as a mediator between creator and music
* To play music that would be impossible or difficult for a human to perform
* To map visuals to music

# Why

It's interesting to use algorithms to generate music. Both music and algorithms are processes in that they unfold over time. So a music-generating algorithm is this strange kind of process that creates processes. 

Another reason is that the computer can host to powerful environments for doing creative work, like creating music. Software environments can enable musicians to create music that they wouldn't otherwise be able to create. I'm interested in exploring the ways software can mediate, augment, reinforce, lay bare, and otherwise work with the creative process. 

Finally, this project is an opportunity to explore ways of visualizing music, making music and graphics work in unison as two ways of perceiving the same process.
